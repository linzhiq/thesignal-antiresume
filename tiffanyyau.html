        <p class="center description">I graduated from the College in 2018 and am currently pursuing my Masters in Nonprofit
                Leadership at Penn’s School of Social Practice & Policy. In addition to continuing to run Hult Prize Ivy,
                which I founded my junior summer, I launched my company, Fulphil. Fulphil is a social enterprise helping
                students in Philadelphia universities to create ventures that have positive impact in Philadelphia. I had
                the idea to create it in November 2017 of my senior year and we just launched on July 4th, 2018. After 3
                months since launch, we’ve expanded to 13 different campuses across Philadelphia, impacting 1000 young people,
                and have been recognized as the driving force of Philadelphia's social entrepreneurship amongst students by
                Generocity and the the Social Innovation Journal.<br>

                                <li> The biggest takeaway from my time at Penn in undergrad is, there is no one set
                                    path to success. Oftentimes, it's easy to get carried away and feel pressured for
                                    not attending the same OCR session as your colleagues or studying something
                                    unconventional. The fact is, we're all different people with different interests
                                    and passions with our varied backgrounds. I'm a huge advocate of people following
                                    their passions - once you recognize your passion and follow it, you'll find a way
                                    to make things work even when times are tough.</li>
